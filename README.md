# thinkful-recipe-crud

Project description: Recipe CRUD

A CRUD application allows a user to create, read, update or delete selected data. For this project, you will build the interface of a food recipe CRUD app. The interface won't use a database or an API to store the data; it will require you to use React's useState() hook.

For detailed instructions on how to complete this project, consult the Instructions document in the Qualified assessment interface.
